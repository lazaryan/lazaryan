### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sergey and I am a Front-end developer with a great desire to constantly grow as a developer and bring something new to the IT world.

My main stack is `JavaScript`, but I am developing in other directions as well.
- âš¡ I am writing `Back-end` in python, Nodejs, Rust;
- ðŸŒ± Studied ML a little;
- ðŸ¤” Worked with `Blockchain Ethereum` and wrote smart contracts for it in Solidity (and linked with services using web3);
- ðŸ”­ Now I study `computer graphics` and how games work from the inside.

I am constantly developing and do not think to be satisfied with what has already been achieved âœ¨
